# Additional Comments/Criteria
* We prefer if you use Github for your source code management, commit early and often and give us the path to your project.
* This is an opportunity to show us what you can develop, be creative and precise. Show us what you can do!
* If you don't want to use a ZIP, you can use Github, provide us with the path to your project.
* Functionality is critical, looks are important.
* Additional Features are never a bad idea.
* If you need to feed anything on a web service or database, use your judgement on how to implement, but it must be included in the submission.
* Assuming you are writing production level code, comments and unit testing should be expected
